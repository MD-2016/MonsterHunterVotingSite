# Monster Hunter Voting Site

## Introduction
   The goal of this project is to build a voting application where the user can vote on their favorite monster from the monster hunter series created by Capcom. Images of monsters are psuedo-randomly generated so the you have them in a "VS" and you click a vote button that corresponds to that monster. After the user votes for their monster, those votes are retained for that monster and eventually the results are ranked by highest tally of votes for a given monster. This voting application supports mobile and desktop.

## Technology Used
